Hi, my name is Issam Azrof and welcome to my personel website!

This little corner of the internet is where I share my hacking adventures. Think of it as my personal notebook.

What You'll Find Here:

* CTF write ups: I'm gonna walk you through my thought process, the tools I used, and how I finally solve them.

* Cybersecurity Topics: Beyond CTFs, I'll be sharing whatever cybersecurity stuff catches my eye. Could be a new exploit, a cool tool or a new technique.

* Learning & Growing: I'm always learning, and this blog is part of that journey. I'll share resources, tips, and anything else that's helped me along the way.


So, pull up a chair, grab a coffee, and let's hack the world!
